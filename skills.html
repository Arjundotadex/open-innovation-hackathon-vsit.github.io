                    Skills development is the process of <br>(1) identifying your skill gaps, and<br> (2) developing and
                    honing
                    these skills. It is important because your skills determine your ability to execute your plans with
                    success.
                    Imagine a carpenter trying to build a house. He has the raw materials but lacks good wood working
                    tools. He has, however, a flimsy hammer and a small screwdriver. Without the right tools like a hand
                    saw, he can’t turn these raw materials into house building pieces.
                    It’s the same with goal achievement. In goal achievement, your skills are your tools. The house is
                    your goal. Just as you need the right tools to build a house, you need the right skills to build
                    your goal. Without the right skills, you will only frustrate yourself, waste your time, and spend a
                    lot of time
                    dealing with rudimentary issues caused by the lack of knowledge or lack of skills, as opposed to
                    progressing in your goal. While difficulty and struggle is part and parcel of any goal pursuit,
                    without the right skills, you find yourself struggling more than necessary. Worse still, this
                    struggle is unconstructive and doesn’t help you move forward.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Why Skills Development is Neglected?</b><br>
                    Yet, why is skills development often neglected?

                    <br>There are two main reasons.

                    Firstly, people are often impressed by what others have accomplished without realizing what they
                    went through to get there. We see their accolades and victories, and make gross assumptions about
                    what it takes to succeed. Then we become disappointed when we attempt the goal, only to find out
                    that it’s not as easy as it seems.

                    This is very common in blogging. People see big name internet “gurus” making 6–7 figure income from
                    blogging. Thinking that it’s easy, and perhaps perpetuated by the claims of said gurus who happen to
                    sell you courses claiming to help you do the same, these folks start blogging as well, expecting to
                    achieve the same results in a short period of time. They become rudely awakened when they don’t even
                    get a trickle of traffic after a few months, much less earn an income. Some press on; many give up.

                    Secondly, many of us can be heavily self-critical. We look at how successful others are — the top
                    coaches, internet gurus, award-winning performers, winners of society — and conclude that we can
                    never achieve the same. We feel that these people are somehow blessed with some special power that
                    we don’t have. I often have clients who say they want to achieve XYZ goal, but after seeing very
                    established folks in the field, feel unconfident about their abilities. They then wonder, What makes
                    me think that I can succeed? I should just give up because these people are already so good and
                    experienced. Who am I to compete?

                    Yet, it’s about skills development. When we see others’ successes, what we don’t see are the
                    countless hours they spent behind the scenes, honing their craft, and building their skills. What we
                    see as “talent” in others is the result of their 10,000 hours of hard work where raw passion and
                    human potential are turned into hard skills. Skills development is where we turn from beginner to
                    novice, to intermediate, to senior, to expert. And henceforth, having the ability to conquer our
                    goal.

                    Example: My Writing
                    Writing notes in a book

                    When I started my blog, I knew that blog writing would be an important skill to master. Yet, I was
                    not an English major; neither had I taken any writing courses before. I was a Business student and
                    in business school we did tons of project work and case studies — nothing to do with literary
                    writing. The one class I took that came closest to writing was a Business Communications module, and
                    even then what was taught was totally different from blog writing.

                    So before I started my blog, I spent weeks reading up on good content writing, including selecting
                    great topics, writing enticing headlines, and understanding traits of good articles. I read blogs
                    like Copyblogger, Men with Pens and Zen To Done. I also analyzed articles from popular blogs,
                    including blogs I followed, to understand how they structured their posts. After all, if they were
                    doing well, they must be doing something right! I would dissect each article as I tried to
                    understand the author’s thinking process, and then sought to apply that in my writing. I also
                    created an article roadmap and brainstormed on topics to write on, topics that<br> (a) were popular,
                    <br>(b)
                    met people’s needs, and <br>(c) were timeless.<br>

                    Even then, my initial articles took really long to write. I remember my first series was on “How To
                    Find Your Life Purpose” as purpose is the starting point of a conscious life. I took over a week to
                    craft out the 7-part series; some parts were totally rewritten before I published them! Some of my
                    earlier articles were pretty crappy too. I would read them and cringe, thinking, Did I actually
                    write this?? I would delete the ones that were not so relevant, while rewriting others to improve
                    the content. In fact, this very article you’re reading now was written in 2009 and I’m now rewriting
                    it in 2016.

                    But I improved. I got better. Today, I’d like to think that my writing is much sharper and on point.
                    My language skills have also improved as I’m more aware of grammatical nuances. I’m more aware of
                    the nuances between American and British English, including punctuation oddities (in Singapore we
                    use British English, though I write in American English here as a higher proportion of PE readers
                    are from the U.S.). Some of my articles have been used in school curriculum, media publications, and
                    business newsletters; many have been shared on forums and social media.

                    Did these happen overnight? No, whatever little writing skills I have today didn’t magically happen.
                    Neither was I “born” with the ability to write. They came from a conscious effort to build my
                    skills, to be a better writer.

                    The same goes for other skills that I didn’t know and had to build at the start of my business
                    journey: coaching, training, new media, responsive web design, web marketing, among many others.
                    Doing so has helped me thrive in my goal to pursue my passion.

                    Likewise, if you are starting in a new goal, it’s about building your skills first. Save for rare
                    situations where one is simply born with a natural predisposition in something (say, Mariah Carey
                    and her five-octave vocal range, though she has acknowledged that her whistle register wasn’t just
                    an innate ability but came from lots of practice[1]), most people cultivate their talent through
                    many hours of hard work. The best coach wasn’t born with coaching skills; he learns it. The best
                    musician wasn’t born with the skill to play musical instruments; he learns it. All these are skills
                    that are developed consciously. And you can do the same too. :<br>

                    Your Skills Development: Hard and Soft Skills
                    In developing your skills, I’d like you to consider two groups of skills:

                    Hard skills: Skills relating to any specific task; they are usually easily quantifiable. They tend
                    to be knowledge-based, such as proficiency in a subject, certification, and technical skills.
                    Fluency in Spanish, skills in XYZ software, graphic design, and programming are all hard skills.
                    Soft skills: Skills relating to personality and tend to be transferable, such as communication,
                    leadership, time management, stress management, decision making, adaptability, ability to deal with
                    adversity, and networking.
                    It’s obvious why hard skills are important. You need domain-level knowledge to thrive in a goal. To
                    be a successful YouTuber, you should at least have some video editing skills. To be a good blogger,
                    you should have good writing skills and a good command of the language. To be a good software
                    engineer, you need to know programming.

                    But many people miss out on soft skills. For example, a writer may insist he is great at writing but
                    get 0 book sales. Assuming his writing skills are top-notch, perhaps he lacks certain soft skills
                    necessary for success, like networking, pitching, and self-marketing. After all, writing a
                    successful book isn’t just about having good writing skills:

                    You need to pitch to publishers/collaborators.
                    You need to market yourself to people.
                    You need insightfulness that helps you understand what people want and how to write stories that
                    resonate with people.
                    Many best-selling authors today aren’t necessary good writers but are either personalities with a
                    large following (some of these folks don’t even write their own books but use a ghost writer) or
                    everyday people with a story that resonates with an audience (Twilight, Fifty Shades of Grey).

                    That’s not to say you focus on soft skills over knowledge. Both hard and soft skills are important.
                    When you succeed based on only soft skills but with no hard skills, you lack the foundation to
                    create new wins. It’s a matter of time before people call you out on your bullshit. When you have
                    only hard but no soft skills, you lack the savviness to hustle and showcase your talent to a bigger
                    crowd out there. Both skills are equally important and complementary to each other.

                    How to Start Developing Skills
                    <br>
                    1. Start with the core skills
                    If you’re starting from ground zero, such as learning programming when you don’t know anything about
                    coding, it can be intimidating as there are a multitude of things to learn. Start with core skills
                    first.

                    Core skills are skills you absolutely need to succeed in your goal. They have a direct impact on
                    your success.
                    Secondary skills are of lower importance vs. the core skills. While they accentuate your success,
                    your expertise in them do not make or break your goal.
                    For example, when I started my business, there were many skills I had to pick up. I started with the
                    core skills that I felt would be instrumental to my success: writing, coaching, training, and web
                    marketing. These skills had a make-or-break effect on my goal. On the other hand, Pinterest,
                    Facebook marketing, Twitter, and fancy web design, while helpful, were not instrumental to my
                    success. These were consequently my secondary skills. While I took some time to learn the secondary
                    skills, I dedicated the bulk of my time to mastering my core skills.

                    What determines a core or secondary skill? It depends on your goal. As long as the skill has a
                    critical impact on your goal, it is considered a core skill. If your goal is to be a life coach with
                    a team of sub-coaches, then life coaching, leadership, team management, and training will be your
                    core skills. If your goal is to be a life coach with an online setup, then life coaching, web
                    marketing, content writing, and good technical skills will be your core skills.

                    In times when it’s not effective to learn certain skills, I recommend to outsource instead. Read my
                    outsourcing guide here.
                    <br>
                    2. Break into little steps
                    With each skill, break the learning into small steps.

                    Back when I was learning life coaching, I identified the sub-skills that would make a good coach,
                    including listening skills, questioning skills, empathy, and patience. I subsequently gave myself a
                    rating of 1–10 on each skill and worked on these skills by giving free sessions, taking a coaching
                    workshop, reading books, and most importantly, working with people. I also developed my own coaching
                    guidebook, which is my repository of coaching concepts and frameworks to coach people. I would
                    collect feedback and review my performance after each coaching session, including identifying things
                    that I did and didn’t do well in, so I could improve.

                    Doing these steps helped me become proficient quickly. I moved from coaching 1 person, to 2, to 4,
                    to 8, to 10 people within a few months. Soon I was coaching my 20th client, and then my 50th, and
                    then my 100th. Before long I was seeing clear trends in my clients’ aspirations and problems and
                    could help them in a pinpointed manner. I also became proficient where I was able to accurately
                    analyze each client’s problems with a brief background and simple questions, and subsequently guide
                    them out of their mental blocks.

                    Developing a skill can be a lofty project, so break it up into little chunks. Don’t expect to reach
                    “master” status right away but focus on conquering each section, one bit at a time. For seemingly
                    unquantifiable soft skills, assign quantifiable milestones to guide you. For example, if you want to
                    cultivate networking skills, you can start by going to X new events and reaching out to X new people
                    each week, and subsequently practice how you introduce yourself and pitch your ideas to others,
                    iterate accordingly, and so on.

                    3. Learn from the best
                    One of the best ways to learn is to learn from the best. That’s because you can understand from
                    someone who’s “been there done that” and get their wisdom rather than proceed unguided. Here are
                    some tips:

                    Who are the people you know, who have experience in this area? Approach them for advice. Ask them:
                    How should you build your skill in this area? Do they have any tips for you? What should you watch
                    out on?
                    Engage a coach. Getting a coach isn’t cheap, but if you have the financial resources and you get the
                    right coach, you can shave hundreds of hours off your learning curve. My clients, through our
                    sessions together, have saved hundreds of hours and sped ahead in their goals, compared to if they
                    had struggled and dealt with these issues alone.
                    Get a mentor. Is there a senior in your company or your network of contacts who would be willing to
                    mentor you?
                    Study experts in the industry. Who are the experts in your field? Study them and understand what
                    makes them so good at what they do. Model their behavior, while adapting it to fit you.
                    <br>4. Research
                    Research to gather different insights and perspectives. The internet has made information more
                    accessible than ever. Research via these tools:

                    Blogs. Blogs have become the primary way we receive information. Use Google to find new blogs.
                    Bookmark the blogs that look promising.
                    Podcasts. In our modern world where most of our time is spent at computers, I find audio a
                    refreshing way to learn. iTunes and Stitcher are podcast directories with tons of free podcasts,
                    while Audible is an audio book portal (it’s a premium service, though your first audio book is
                    free). PE Podcast is listed on iTunes and Stitcher.
                    Books. Books are great sources of information as they are essentially very structured forms of
                    content, usually a collection of the author’s best wisdom on the topic. Is there a library where you
                    live? If so, head to the library and borrow books related to the subject. If not, hit the bookstores
                    and check out their recommended books.
                    Free online courses. Online courses has become a huge thing in recent years. Here are some free
                    course portals, including from renowned universities:
                    Coursera
                    edX
                    Harvard online courses
                    Stanford online courses
                    Academic Earth
                    <br> 5. Attend trainings
                    Courses and workshops are great ways to quickly develop skills. Think of it as a concentrated source
                    of information that has been organized into a structured program for your learning. Depending on the
                    workshop, some workshops with a lot of activities allow for experiential learning, which means you
                    get hands-on practice rather than learning through theory via reading. When you attend a training,
                    you are in the company of like-minds, which gives you added motivation and social support in your
                    goal.

                    When looking for a training, be careful to look for one with actual content and taught by a credible
                    trainer. Ask for a breakdown of the course curriculum. There are many courses today that are filled
                    with fluff and taught by people who are more interested in profits than in the teaching, and you
                    want to stay away from these.

                    <br>6. Take action
                    With all that said and done, it comes down to doing. Like I share in this article, doing helps you
                    learn faster than simply reading.

                    Earlier in the article, I shared that I built my coaching skills by reading up, taking a workshop,
                    and working with people. The latter was the most crucial part of my learning process, for if I had
                    never practiced by working with real people, I would never have known what are the things people
                    need help in, how to best help them, and whether my methods work. This is something I mentioned in
                    Are Coaching Courses Necessary To Be a Coach? — ultimately, what builds expertise isn’t theory, but
                    practice. This is especially so if your skill has a actionable component. That’s when you know how
                    good you are, your blind spots, the gap between hypothesis and reality, and your areas for
                    improvement.

                    “Doing” here depends on the skill you are building. If you’re learning to program, it means writing
                    code, creating simple software, and testing them. If you are learning public speaking, it means
                    practicing in front of the mirror, taping yourself and reviewing your performance, and speaking in
                    front of real people, events.

                    While the action phase is probably the scariest phase of all, it is the most rewarding phase because
                    that’s when you learn the most. That’s when you stop hiding in a bubble, get out of your comfort
                    zone, and jump-start your learning. : The more hours you put in, the better you will become.
                    Allocate time to practice each day.
